The application should be compatible with both Android and iOS so either we turn this into flutter or React
Allow users to save their information on their app 
Allow users to add their friends on the group 
Allow information storage on cloud so that the data is not lost when the app is uninstalled
Allow users to create groups and add members to the group 
To add a user in the initial go, we should create a unique joining URL so that the invited user can join (flow -> Create group -> craete a shareable link , user clicks on the link -> sings up and auto joins the group)
Or We can create a notification centre of the app, when a user installs the app, on the notifcation centre, the user gets a notification "User X added you in Group Y - Click here to accept and Join" Once the user joins they are part of the groupd, they can now split and add bills whenever they want
